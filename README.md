# MyUniTasks

This project is a minimalist **To-Do List** app for iOS built using **UIKit** and **UserDefaults** to store tasks locally. The app follows a black-and-green theme and allows users to create, edit, and delete to-do items, each with a due date.

## Features
- Add tasks with a title and due date.
- Save tasks locally using **UserDefaults**, so they persist even after the app is closed.
- Swipe to delete tasks.
- Black and green hacker-style theme with custom fonts and colors.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift**
- **UIKit**
- **UserDefaults** (for local storage)
